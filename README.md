# GST Automation Agent

This repository contains a personal automation agent to extract invoice data using Tesseract OCR
and file invoices into the GST portal using Playwright (MCP).

Features:
- Minimal web UI to upload invoices
- Background worker using BullMQ + Redis to process OCR and automation
- SQLite DB to track job status
- Playwright script with OTP pause (manual OTP input)
- Docker Compose for local deployment (app + worker + redis)

**IMPORTANT**: This project interacts with a government portal; use responsibly and only for personal tasks.

## Quickstart (local)

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit values.
2. Install deps:
   ```bash
   npm ci
   npx playwright install
   ```
3. Start with Docker Compose (recommended):
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
Or run locally (ensure Redis running at REDIS_URL):
```bash
npm run dev
# in another shell
npm run worker
```

## Pushing to GitHub

Create a repo `gst-automation-agent` under your account (`Anurag101292`), then run:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - gst automation agent"
